      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <section class="selector">
        <p>We are surrounded by many methods of help to keep track of our fitness and health goals. One powerful tool people
          use for health and fitness tracking are Fitness Bands, courtesy of various manufacturers such as Xiaomi, FitBit
          and many more. Unfortunately, we can not compare our fitness and health statistics captured across different brands
          unless we directly communicate with others, and looking at various graphs and complicated data can be a drag! Therefore,
          what better way to implement a community platform that combines the data generated using these fitness trackers
          and allow users to compare their statistics with each other in a no-fuss way.

      <h3>Our Goals</h3>
      <section class="selector">
        <p>The goal is simple. As explained above, we hope this new platform of fitness tracking and data collection combines
          your already existing data from your tracker which can then be used to compare to other users across different
          brands. In addition to this, data will also be formatted into a leaderboard based on a score algorithm we apply
          to every user in various categories (Steps taken, Calories burnt etc.) and compete for badges! We hope this platform
          offers users the easiest and most effective way to share their fitness achievements with others without the existing
          restrictions!
